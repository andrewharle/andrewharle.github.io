Description: object/document-oriented database (metapackage)
 MongoDB is a high-performance, open source, schema-free
 document-oriented data store that's easy to deploy, manage
 and use. It's network accessible, written in C++ and offers
 the following features:
 .
    * Collection oriented storage - easy storage of object-style data
    * Full index support, including on inner objects
    * Query profiling
    * Replication and fail-over support
    * Efficient storage of binary data including large objects (e.g. videos)
    * Auto-sharding for cloud-level scalability
 .
 High performance, scalability, and reasonable depth of
 functionality are the goals for the project.
 .
 This is a convenience metapackage that depends on all the mongodb parts:
 the server, the clients and the development files (headers and library).
